            <p>You see the Wizard in his elegantly decorated parlor having tea and listening to Lofi Hip Hop Radio - Beats To Relax/Study To.</p>
            <p><img src="wizardtea.jpg" alt="Tea Time" width="500px"></p>
        <p>Alas you are face to face with your archenemy. He notices you walk in and the two of you make awkward eye contact for a moment.</p>
            <p>You don't have an attack ready because you were charging a defensive spell. Any attack you launch will be weak, especially against the wizard Ravendrous Fierin, <b>The Overpowered</b>. However, you aren't panicing because the music is so relaxing.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">Your awkward eye contact has gone on for too long and you're both cringing. Think quick!</p>
