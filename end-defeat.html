        <h2><p>You're attack was just as weak as the last one and you've spilt his tea once more. However, the Wizard did not find it as funny the second time and he blasts you into the sun. Maybe you should fued with a reasonably powered Wizard next time.</p>
        <p>You manage to survive being blasted into the sun somehow so on the bright side you can boast about surviving being inside the sun. No one else can do that!</p>
        <p>Plus, you were brave and confident the whole time. Those are good qualities! Even though you got wrecked, you choose to see this as a sort of pyrrhic victory.</p></h2>
