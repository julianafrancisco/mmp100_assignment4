            <p><img src="wizardfriends.jpg" alt="Two Wizards Out on The Town" width= "500px"></p>
            <p>The Wizard is confused as to why you entered his castle without permission but he is flattered none the less. You propose a peace treaty to end your pointless fued. The Wizard assures you that he never saw you as a credible threat to begin but he alwyas admired your spirit. You choose to take this as a compliment.</p>
            <p>He offers you a cup of tea and as you drink you bond over music and the Wizard's amazing art collection. You realize the Wizard is chill and now that you're friends you can probably become his apprentice.</p>
            <p>You and the Wizard are pals now, and regularly attend concerts together. You feel proud of yourself for putting aside your pride and ending your feud peacefully. You're happy the fued is over and that you made a new friend.</p>
            <p>Good thing because he would have crushed you.</p>
