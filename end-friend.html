            <p>The Wizard is confused why you entered their castle without permission but is flattered none the less. You bond over music and you ask them where they get their furniture. He tells you conjures it himself and offers to show you how.</p>
            <p>You spend the evening having tea and obsessing over furniture catalogues. You realize the Wizard is chill and neither of you remember why you're fueding to begin with.</p>
            <p>You and the Wizard are pals now, and regularly attend concerts together. You feel proud of yourself for putting aside your pride and ending your pointless feud peacefully. You're happy the fued is over and that you made a new friend.</p>
            <p>Good thing because he would have crushed you.</p>
