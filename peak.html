        <h2><p>You see the Wizard in their elegantly decorated parlor having tea and listening to Lofi Hip Hop Radio - Beats To Relax/Study To. He does not notice you peaking in as he is thoroughly savoring his tea. The tea smells delicious and you're pretty thirsty because of your long journey. You think to yourself that the Wizard has good taste and it may be worth it to bury the hatchet if it means you get some good tea and home decor.</p>
            <p>However, if you attack now you will catch him off guard, even if it isn't a fair fight. You're here to <i>defeat</i> the Wizard, fair fight or not.</p>
