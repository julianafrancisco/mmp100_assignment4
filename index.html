    <h1>A Tale of Two Wizards</h1>
        <h2><p>You have journeyed the land in search of your archenemy: Ravendrous Fierin, The Overpowered. Finally, you have found his secret castle. You don't remember when or why your fighting began, but whether you live or die, it ends tonight...</p>
        <p><img src="castle.jpg" alt="Wizard's Castle" width="500px"></p>
        <p>As you approach his castle you see that the castle door is wide open. Is he expecting your arrival?</p>
        <p>From the corner of your eye you noticed an open window off to the side of the castle. A simple levitation spell will allow you to enter but it will cost you lots of mana.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center">Think quick before he notices you standing outside scratching your head.</p>
        <p><a href="door.html">Go through the door</a><a href="window.html" style="float: right;">Sneak in through the window</a></p>
