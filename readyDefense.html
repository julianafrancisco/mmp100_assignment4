        <h1>Defense Wins Games</h1>
        <h2><p>It's important to not underestimate your enemy, especially if they have "The Overpowered" in their title.</p>
            <p><img src="defensespell.jpg" alt="Preparing a defence spell" width=500px></p>
            <p>You step forward with caution, readying your defense and reciting all the spells you know in your head. You wonder if you have what it takes to defeat your nemesis, him being overpowered and all. You remember that you've gotten this far because of your resourcefulness and wit. You trust your abilities and proceed with confidence.</p>
            <p>As you get closer the feeling of anxiety builds but you know you're ready for whatever the Wizard will throw at you.</p>
            <p>You reach the end of the hallway. Should you step right in? You're as ready as you'll ever be. Or should you peak inside and get an idea of whats inside before you go in.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">Make your next move.</p>
