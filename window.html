            <p>You find yourself in the Wizard's beautifully decorated study. As you courteously close the window behind you, you admire his chandelier and carefully curated artwork. 
            </p>
            <p>As you consider forgetting about the Wizard and making off with a painting or two, you hear odd stirrings coming from the next room.</p>
            <p>Could that be the Wizard? Was the open door a trap or does he not know you're here?</p>
            <p>You can either proceed with caution, readying your most powerful defense spell to prepare for the worst, or charge in readying your most powerful attack spell to catch him off gaurd</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">Choose quickly before your thoughts go back to larceny.</p>
